# nerdcorepodcasts
*Scraping all the great podcasts collected by [Nerdcore.de](http://www.nerdcore.de) for your podcast app.*

Based on Google App engine (GAE), Python and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). The service is simply transfering Nerdcore's podcast category RSS into a podcast-only RSS. Thus it's readable by common podcast apps like [Antennapod](http://antennapod.org).

*Thanks to Ren√© Walter for the curation of the podcasts.*
